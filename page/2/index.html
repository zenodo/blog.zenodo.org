<hr />
<div class="body"><h4>TL;DR</h4>
<p>Zenodo.org will be unavailable for 2 hours on September 29th from 06:00-08:00 UTC.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You MUST save any changes in advance of the migration window to avoid losing the changes. In particular, make sure you click "Save" button on any upload (unpublished as well as published).</div><h2>Zenodo relaunching on next-generation platform - InvenioRDM</h2>
<p>We're excited to finally announce the launch date for migrating Zenodo to our next-generation platform. On September 29th, Zenodo's underlying technical platform will be migrated to InvenioRDM, a digital repository platform born out of Zenodo and developed together with 25 partners. See also our <a href="https://blog.zenodo.org/2022/12/07/2022-12-07-zenodo-on-inveniordm/">earlier announcement</a>.</p>
<h3>Demo site</h3>
<p>You can see a demo of the new Zenodo at <a href="https://zenodo-rdm-qa.web.cern.ch">https://zenodo-rdm-qa.web.cern.ch</a>. The demo site has a snapshot of Zenodo production data from end-August.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><strong>Work in progress:</strong> You'll notice that not everything is finished yet. E.g. record files and community logos are not yet visible as the demo system does not have access the live data. Similarly, some features still need the final polish which is being done throughout September.</div><p><strong>Logging in</strong></p>
<p>If you have an account on Zenodo.org, you can login on the demo site by <a href="https://zenodo-rdm-qa.web.cern.ch/lost-password/">resetting your password</a> using the same email address as you registered with on Zenodo.org.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>Why must I save the changes before the migration?</h4>
<p>We are setting up an entirely new production system, and thus once the intervention is over you will be required to login again. This means that any page you had open on Zenodo.org prior to the intervention starting, will no longer be able to interact with Zenodo after the intervention is over, and thus the changes you made will be lost. To avoid losing changes, you must simply ensure that you save any changes prior to the intervention starting on Sep 29 at 06:00 UTC.</p>
<h4>What's new/changed?</h4>
<p>We're launching several new features together with the release as well. A full announcement is going out two weeks in advance of the release, thus following is a quick overview of some of the new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community members</strong>: Ability for multiple users to curate/manage a community, as well as the ability of community members to see files in restricted records.</li>
<li><strong>Reviews</strong>: Community curators will be able to edit submissions to their community, and have a conversation with the submitter to fix issues prior to the submission.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong>: New options for sharing records with specific users and as well as generating secret links that can be shared.</li>
<li><strong>Deposit form</strong>: Auto-completion of creators/contributors, affiliations and subjects from ORCiD, ROR, and OECD Fields of Science and Technology as well as improved funding and license selectors.</li>
<li><strong>Web accessibility</strong>: We still have to make many more improvements towards being level AA complaint with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, however the new platform has overall made significant improvements to web accessibility of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>User interface</strong>: Zenodo will look familiar, but we've introduced many smaller usability improvements to the user interface as well as better usage of screen space.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Will feature X still work?</h4>
<p>Yes, we provide backward compatibility for all existing features. We will be launching a series of new and improved features which will be announced 2 weeks before the migration.</p>
<h4>Will your APIs be backward compatible?</h4>
<p>Yes, we do our outmost to ensure backward compatibility of our APIs, and that your integration will continue to work on the new platform as well.</p>
<h4>Will I be required to update my API integration?</h4>
<p>After Zenodo on InvenioRDM has been launched, we will deprecate some of our existing APIs. We will provide a migration period of 1-year for the transition. New features will only be available on the new API. The new API is similar to the existing API to ease the transition.</p>
<h4>Will the community curators be able to edit my existing records?</h4>
<p>If your record has been accepted into a community which you're not the owner of, you will receive a request to grant community curators access to edit the metadata of your record. If you decline the request, your record will be removed from the community. If you neither accept or decline the request within 6 months, the community curators will be granted access to edit the metadata.</p>
<h4>Will community curators be able to view the files of my closed access or restricted record?</h4>
<p>If your record has been accepted into a community which you're not the owner of and your record is either closed access or restricted access, you will receive a request to grant community curators access to view the files of your closed/restricted record. If you decline the request, or you do not accept the request within 6 months, your record will be automatically removed from the community.</p>
<h4>Will old links still work?</h4>
<p>Yes. We have ensured that all old links have been redirected to their new location. This include e.g. also a translation layer that ensure search queries still work.</p>
<h4>You're releasing on Friday?</h4>
<p>Yes. The migration process starts already on Monday Sep 25th and will last throughout the week. In addition we have senior staff on duty during the full weekend in case of any problems.</p>

<p>Zenodo was launched 10 years ago on May 8th by <a href="https://home.cern">CERN</a> and <a href="https://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE</a>. The goal since day one has been to enable any researcher from anywhere in the world to participate in practising open science. Today, 10 years later, Zenodo supports more than 300,000 researchers in 7500+ research organisations in 153 countries to do just that. A recent study<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> conservatively estimated the socio-economic impact of Zenodo in society to 95 million EUR per year but more likely close to 1 billion EUR/year. All in support of the mission to provide the platform for all researchers to publicly share their work and join the open science movement.</p>
<p>We always believed that research data should end up where researchers can care best for them, whether that be a subject/institute/national repository, but we also knew that gaps in the offerings still left an enormous quantity of research data with nowhere else to go, that we could usefully offer help to.</p>
<p>Zenodo is now a core enabler of open science practice by providing trusted long-term storage of research, especially to those in most need and without the means. CERN is a leader of Big Data storage, creating technologies at the scale frontier, already keeping almost 1 exabyte of high-energy physics data safe. By housing Zenodo in a corner of the CERN Data Centre, we use this expertise to share <em>what we find easy with others that find it hard</em>.</p>
<h3>Thank you</h3>
<p>We would also like to send a BIG thank you to all our funders and donors who have sustained our growth and seen the value of our offering.</p>
<p>A special thank you goes to:</p>

[1] The Future Circular Collider Innovation Study (funded by the European Union under grant number <a href="https://doi.org/10.3030/951754">951754</a>) studied the socio-economic impact potentials of open data and software for a Future Circular Collider based on an analysis of the LHC. This included an analysis of Zenodo by PhD student Irene Crespo Garrido supervised by Johannes Gutleber (CERN) and María Loureiro García (University de Santiago de Compostela) to be published later in 2023.

<p><strong>Virtual Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI) Workshop</strong></p>
<p>Tuesday, January 24 11am-4pm ET &amp; Wednesday January 25 11am-3:30pm ET
Registration and agenda at: <a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/news/grei-workshop-january-24-25-2023">https://datascience.nih.gov/news/grei-workshop-january-24-25-2023</a></p>
<p>This 2-day virtual workshop is presented by the seven generalist repositories participating in the <a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/data-ecosystem/exploring-a-generalist-repository-for-nih-funded-data">Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI)</a>, sponsored by the <a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/">NIH Office of Data Science Strategy</a>.</p>
<p>The GREI workshop will focus on GREI's vision of developing collaborative approaches for data management and sharing through inclusion of the generalist repositories in the NIH data ecosystem, and to better enable search and discovery of NIH-funded data in the generalist repositories. The workshop is aimed at researchers of all stages including those funded by NIH and those who support data sharing at academic institutions, funders, publishers, repositories, and beyond.</p>
<p>The workshop will feature keynote speakers and panel discussions with leaders in open data from the research community, NIH, and data community organizations. Interactive training sessions led by GREI repositories will present use-case-specific guidance on sharing and discovering data in generalist repositories. The workshop will also gather community feedback to inform future GREI work to enhance support for NIH data sharing with common functionality, interoperability, and “coopetition” among generalist repositories.</p>
